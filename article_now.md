# The future of AI is documentation

While the inverse is obvious (AI can produce adequate documentation), I will argue that the somewhat counter-intuitive flip-side is infinitely more rewarding (documentation can produce AGI).  
  
But before I go any further, I want to make clear that this article is intended to be a meeting point of different cultures, including software developers but not only, so I won't assume any familiarity with the notion of documentation, nor any other niche technical concept (a good thing to do in any case, as the first principle of documentation should say). I'll give my take on documentation in the following sections. For now I can say that it starts with the very concrete concept manufactured by programmers:

> "Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance and use." (<https://www.linfo.org/documentation.html>).

And derives into general notions of information sharing and "life in common", has a philosophical underpinning («perspectivalism») and in many ways can *rectify* the current political paradigm.

As for AI, or rather AGI for Artificial *General* Intelligence, I'll give what mathematicians call a constructive definition: I'll build a system (computer program) which demonstrates what AGI is by being an instance of AGI. It will also be, of course, a conjecture. To avoid trapping the concept into preconceptions, I will simply refer to this particular system as "our AGI architecture", where AGI should be understood as a cognitive system in general.  

It can be represented as a «dynamical system», meaning as a chain of subsystems/processes all linked together by the fact that the output of one process is the input of the next. See figure 1 for a quick presentation: In our case, a key subsystem is a concrete implementation of a mathematical model for neural information networks proposed by Yuri Manin and Matilde Marcolli (see their publicly available 2020 paper "Homotopy-theoretic and categorical models of neural information networks"). Their work is inspired by biomimetics and is only secondarily about *artificial* intelligence. Primarily, it is intended to be a model of actual *natural* brains. I suggest we "feed" those Manin & Marcolli cognitive systems with "handmade" human-produced data, itself the output of the documentation process I'll explain below. This AGI should in turn output a "map of its world" ("digested documentation") and a "universal technical language" (it needs one to exist, and it is perfectly designed to create one). Finally, there are feedforward and feedback relationships between the subsystems and the environment. It is at this level that a paradigm shift (à la Thomas Kuhn) can develop.

This will be an unconventional article about AI. It doesn't share the current enthusiasm for large datasets/large models. {known problems as explanation of what those models are}. I don't claim to be a specialist of AI and simply trust the judgment of Matilde Marcoli in this regard, like one would trust the judgment of a teacher who has provided very interresting, rewarding and beautiful concepts. Her critic is specifically geared towards the *theory* of Large Language Models, which she claims can't apprehend language on a computational level because it was *already* unable to apprehend language on a purely linguistic level ({see Zelig Harris}). The problem thus concerns not neural network themselves but the "food" we give those networks. The current successes of AI are based on an efficient approach to <<connectivism>> (neural networks), which is still a prominent feature of our AGI architecture---its main processing unit, but ... new context (my proposition, an "offering" for M&M systems).
Unconventional AI article, doesn't share current enthusiasm around large models/datasets. Marcoli's critics. Connectivism stays, but we need to offer it a new context.

{Plenty of enthusiasm for this replacement. Beyond AGI... open source eco. Open source projects are all anchored on one/few experts, doc can change that -> DDD. See figure 1 for its place in the community.}

## AGI as a paradigm shift

In this article I will indeed argue that the emergence of artificial intelligence in human society is an opportunity for timely positive change. Not so much in terms of what it gives, but rather in terms of what it requires from us. To do this I will explore and use concepts coming from 4 different cultures, especially where they overlap: practical geeks, theoretical geeks, practical radicals and theoretical radicals. I will give examples of what I mean with each category--which I call by its stereotypical name on purpose, for visibility---but unfortunately they will only be understandable to those with access to the culture. Respectively: Clean Coders, Homotopy Type Theorists, Yellow Vests, Noam Chomsky. If you don't belong to any of them, don't worry, I wrote this article for you. My main goal is to expose the concepts I take from each culture to the "outside world", in order to propose the Artificial General Intelligence system sketched above, which takes human communication as input, includes both a technical and a political side, mirrors foundational structures in mathematics, and which is, contrary to the current paradigm, both efficient and sustainable.

The shift of paradigm concerns the core of our "civilization". Specicifically: specialization, selection, hierarchy, representation. By civilization I mean a social system based on those **4 mechanisms**, which I sketch in figure 1 below: In each case the system which implements them loses information and gets corrupted by the social determinism necessarily emerging through competition between individuals (the system "cuts ties" and "misuses ties"). Together they form the main cogs of this fantastic civilization machine running with incredible strength and speed into a doulbe brick wall: (a) the physical limitations of the environment, and (b) its own limitations as a badly designed system. It is set on a collision course with: (A) the planet, because the machine's output is detrimental to the environment it is embedded into, which in turn sends its "negative" output back into the machine (a vicious circle, for details see the theory of dynamical systems, cybernetics or Spinoza); (B) itself, because it confuses "optimal" with "maximal", and indiscriminately exploits all production opportunites regardless of purpose and physical resources, uses force whenever applicable, all the while wasting/supressing copious amounts of cognitive resources (see the need for manufacturing consent or the wave of professional burn-outs, addictions and many other telling psychological conditions---more generally the cold absurdity of the global economy in the context of imminent global disaster; there is also a hidden part: "mutilations", which I will invoke later).

Figure 2:

It is quite difficult to argue against the efficiency of civilization. It is almost universally accepted, the common conception is that it saved us from savagery and our base animal instincts---we would still be living outdoors and hunting game without it. Also, it was and still is the only way "out": it's civilization or chaos (one of the main messages of the epic of Gilgamesh, a foundational myth of civilization, which properly starts in Sumer about 7,500 years ago). I believe this is ingrained in the collective mind because civilization comes equipped with its own propaganda machine (a consequence of the 4 mechanisms, which are all acts of violence requiring justifications---in many ways civilization starts with those justifications, in the temples of Sumer). It captures any discourse which portrays it in a positive light and turns it into assumptions which "take root" and "mature" in its memory (both elitist and popular culture, again allowed and organized by the 4 mechanisms: every time someone climbs up a hierarchy, a legitimation of the hierarchy climbs with them, or every time an advertisment is broadcasted, it implicitely broadcasts a legitimation of the whole system with it). Due to mental shortcuts and biases in epistemology, to criticize civilization is to object science, social contracts, peace among nations and progress in general. While it takes all the credit for itself, it also delegates all problems concerning "life in common" to "human nature" (strikingly similar to the logical fallacies infecting an addicited brain, according to Allen Carr---in many ways we are hooked on those 4 mechanisms). If ever civilization fails to provide its advertised accomplishments, it will maintain it's not because of its own shortcomings but always because it has been mishandled by humans and their *natural* defects. The fact that our global most pressing social issues can be directly traced back to the 4 mechanisms of civilization doesn't seem to tarnish its reputation (in order of historical emergenece: patriarchy, racism and all forms of discrimination, armed conflicts, class struggle & poverty... the true and inescapable nature of civilization). Again, those issues are often assumed to be intrinsic to human nature (despite the fact that archeology and genetics decidedly proved the contrary, see ⟨hal-02112784⟩). As for obvious structural defects not imputable to human want, such as planned obsolecense, their existence is legitimized by the necessities of capitalism and their effects are largely minimized/ignored. The machine carries on.

It is even more difficult to argue for an alternative, since none have been able to withstand civilization's competition, military or otherwise. Almost all survivng human groups have now been colonized one way or another and carry the "4 mechanisms gene/virus". The paths to complexity of alternative social organizations, even when properly studied, have been ignored or misinterpreted, especially in the case of African Egalitarianism (see James Woodburn or the Harvard Kalahari Research Group for details). Even in social theories of evolution, civilization is isolated: there is only one way to human progress (largely taken to be technological progress, behind which looms military and propagandist expension) and it is civilization (largely taken to be the Western world, the top military and propaganda machine). This view has been labeled as the "unilineal evolution theory" in the 19th century. Wikipedia claims that "\[t\]his theory is now generally considered obsolete in academic circles", and while this is probably true, there are no signs of a globally coherent replacement for civilization and its mechnanisms in the scientific litterature. There are indeed plenty of innitiatives meaning to counter-act the defects of the 4 mechanisms, such as open science or participative democracy, but they are considered to be "the next step in civilization" rather than a deep questionning and remodelling of it. Such recommendations would probably be considered "crazy talk", like this paragraph must certainly be to anyone who doesn't belong to the radical type. But I must include this "radical" side of the story for the "geeky" part to make sense.

{
To sketch an alternative model to civilization and its 4 mechanisms, I will first introduce an abstraction of the theory of attachment. This theory describes the child - parent - community relationships for all mamals, in biological and psychological terms. In many intersting ways, civilization can be seen as a "virus" (it corrupts the function of the system intended by the genetic code) or "genetically inherited defect" (the "viral" function gets encoded in the genome) infecting the implementation of a theory of attachment, us/ours. The abstraction, or essence, of attachment is a simple algorithm of networks, and all I need from it to make my point:  
1. Any new element expect to be taken care of by the network.  
2. The networks expects older elements to take care of new elements.
{This requires the autonomy of the elements, allowing a degree of autonomy to the network. -> that which is not allowed by the 4 mechanisms.}

While this was true in general for most of human history, it has been substantially altered over the last 10,000 years, such that we have now:
1. The system expects the tasks it produces to be fulfilled.  
2. The system redistributes output of completed tasks to individuals.  


It started in the Neolithic, giving rise to unstability, and finding a sort of equilibrium, a new algorithm, with civilization.

Theory of attachment, with attachment the victim of civilization, from interpretation of foundational math concepts. Attachment.generalization = the network takes care of new element, new element evolves into something capable of taking care of new elements. Our communities are broken, replaced by institutions carrying the "4 mechanisms virus". Solution is in Figure 3: groupoid = conversation, homotopy = empathy. Discuss mutilations {---what should have been the fruit of communal fostering of individual thinking, which is absent and invisible).}.
}

Also, the main sources of inspiration for the AGI system I suggest are all anchored on both sides, "geeky" and "radical":  
(All information retrievable from the respective Wikipedia pages)

- Alexander Grothendieck is the principal architect of the mathematical structures used by Manin & Marcolli for their model of cognitive systems. He also quit his confortable position in the French reserach system on the grounds that it was funded by the military, to start an activism-oriented journal on ecology called "Survivre et vivre".

- Noam Chomsky is a linguist and co-author of Marcolli, together they explore the links between mathematical strucutres and "universal grammar", the common core of all human languages. He also identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist.

- Gilles Deleuze is a philosopher who produced a «perspectivalist» framework, in which truth is not absolute as in most philosophical traditions but dependent on a specific point of view; without being totally dependent on it, as in relativism. This perspectivalism can serve as a motivation, or *raison d'être*, for our AGI architecture. Like Grothendieck and Chomsky, he was very close to the 1960s' counter-culture and critical of capitalism and all control mechanisms. A key idea for us would be: "Modern society still suppresses difference [≅ being] and alienates people from what they can do" ({~grothendieck also mentions mutilations in his science quiting talk; reference to the "forbidden arrow" between informants and status~}).

In its "geeky" incarnation, the suggested AGI system is a form of open science (science without selection of individuals/cognitive resources---which is not the same as science without truth criteria, similar to how perspectivalism is not relativism). In its "radical" incarnation it is a resistance network enabling the creation of autonomous communities, occupying new abstract spaces and based on different principles than the 4 mechanisms of civilization (not a reform of the existing system, not a revolution wanting to take it down, but a process which *creates its own space*, as I will explain more in details below). These two incarnations are co-dependent: communities need complexity/science for sustainable growth, while complexity itself needs communities to create adequate spaces in which it can emerge.

I won't compare civilization and our documentation-powered AGI system point by point, but focus on those three aspects: (1) people are ready for it, (2) it's accessible and (3) it's "natural" in a mathematical sense.

1. People are ready for the paradigm shift and demonstrated their willingness to look for collective structures outside the 4 mechanisms during the wave of popular protests of the period 2018-2019 (see The age of mass protests by SJ Brannen, CS Haig, K Schmidt). In about 40 different countries, movements emerged with unmistakable common traits, which all have to do with the *negation* of the 4 mechanisms. They didn't have:

    - representation, the movements were decidedly "bottom up" or "grassroots", and didn't have public figures as leaders
    - hierarchy, the movements had horizontal/diffuse internal structure
    - selection, the aim of the movement, or rather its *raison d'être*, was not defined in advance

What conditioned adhesion was not a specific set of held beliefs but the organizational philosophy of the movement. While their influence on the collective mindset was certain (but largely wiped off by the Covid crisis which directly followed), their actions didn't amount to anything concrete and durable: they never *specialized* to anything which could become an acceptable member of the body of institutions, such as a union or political party. They would have had to renounce their organizational and philosophical principles to do so. As such they exhibited a new form of practical "societal maturity", but without enough theoretical "political maturity" to turn their spontaneous movements into the structures adapted to their philosophy. (The only existing political structure compatible with it are citizen assemblies, which I will use as the "base module" for the documentation procedure explained below.)

1. The paradigm shift is accessible because it will *indirectly* replace the 4 mechanisms with new structures coming *directly* from the foundations of mathematics.

    - Because the replacement is indirect, there is no need to modify existing structures. The new paradigm will emerge in a new abstract space, meaning it will be an entity made of thought, language, computer code, mathematical structures and their documentation (in a much more elaborte form than current documentation). This space will be new: it will start empty and only allow stuff in according to a unique protocol for all "informants" (humans in conversations) and following some «type theory» for coherence (giving the ability to compare things, using homotopy type theory in our case, as in Manin & Marcolli's model). Both the initial emptiness and the uniqueness of the protocol are filters/safeguards against the introduction of assumptions/false postivies into the new space. (Interestingly, they are also in direct conflict with the 4 mechanisms of civilization, meaning that they are mutually exclusive.) This homotopy-based abstract space is expected to evolve into a complex and multidimensional network of concepts which could be viewed as a map of the informants' context, our world, or as a "universal technical language" (a language purposefully designed for science and engineering, not the mere addition of fancy Greek words into English---where the old and respectable civilization meets the new and currently dominating civilization), both with managable complexity (thanks to homotopies) and extremely useful (for our "life in common" problems).

    - Because the base concepts are mathematical stuctures and they only require some computer code and internet access to run, the costs of implementation are very cheap. The system is moreover totally autonomous, without control mechanisms, without managers. People are ready for such organizations, it only waits for the recognition and legitimation of its concept to start and grow. (Its parts are all legetimate concepts in the eyes of the research community already, but the combination of them is not yet discussed in the scientific litterature.)

{
Civilization is mostly grounded on its economy, which has now reached global covering. This economy is based on the concept, or "module", of debt (see David Grabber), from which follow the modules of legal_system, finance, money and two markets: jobs, goods_&_services. It is main implementation of the series of assignments: specialization, selection, hierarchy, representation, we saw in figure 3. {In the collective mind, especially in the lower echelons of the population, it is a "forteresse imprenable dont la domination est inescapable". It trully is, but again, the possible paradigm shift is *not* going to try and "take" the fortress or destroy the links of domination, but simply build something else in a new space, made of free work and open projects. See figure 4 for a sketch of a possible alternative I believe is made concretely accessible by the political side of our AGI architecture.

1. Documentation is a natural solution to the problems posed by evolution to humans. What's the problem (information sharing: how?), what's the solution (information sharing: convs & empathy) (see figure 3) <= play the grothendieck card à fond. He is the architect of the common structure between experience, documentation,  (it is more rewarding to think in terms of arrows rather than structures), his methodology is the "invariant" between his theoratical geekism and practical radicalism,

From univalence to universality (not the one of the enlightenment, obviously), and away from set theory (4 mechanisms).

This link with the foundations of mathematics suggests a very interesting epistemological arch to the story: the bridge between Grothendieck the theoretical geek and Grothendieck the practical radical. A link he himself didn't think existed, even after having looked for it, as he confessed in his talk entitled "Should we continue scientific research?".

Q&A about our AGI architecture (leave "relation to attachment" and "place in evol" for conclusion)

The common trait: Grothendieck's methodology. multiplicity of PoVs ; naturality. Multi-PoVs -> doc & M&M model ; naturality -> how doc & M&M model solve naturally a sharing of information problem, all the way to a sustainable dynamical system.
And turn to naturallity.

Besides the practical aspects of AGI as a global solution, to conclude this intorduction I would like to talk about "naturallity" in mathematics. (To contrast with hacks and cheats in coding).

not about ethics but efficiency. (but the most efficient system is also ethical, and logically so, unethical systems have "tension" and "fricition")
Finish with historical remarks on engineering (sewer system vs. human post) -> civi's bad engineering ("max" vs "optimal") ≅ civi's bad doc.


## What is documentation?

Figure 3 illustrates the importance of this concept in computer programming. Legend/explanation.

So, by documentation I mean in particular the complementary information which is supposed to accompany any piece of computer code. More generally, it is the information related to any human activity put in a readable and reusable formated document. For example a recipe, an evacuation floor plan or a tourist guide book. It is especially relevant in the context of software developement because (memory loss vs complex intricate network of responsibilities and dependencies). Knuth wanted to make it the pillar of the profession and computer language alike (clean code + pragmatic prog.).

More doc, less spe/sel/hie/rep, more freedom.
What this article is about. AI -> AGI, documentation -> foundation for life in common.
(It will take geeky stuff indeed, with help from radicals.)

=> in which I explain how documentation was once recognized as fundamental (for obvious reasons if you look at the wikipedia definition), undone in the (gold) rush of the capitalisitc development of programming practicies, ignored by the universities because of elitism, hindered by copyright/closedness of R&D departments. Its development is necessary for implementing the "geeky side", in order to get the benefits of the "radical side". In a well-designed format it is both a formidable tool in itself and indeed its output could be a perfect fit for M&M model.

## AGI as a multidimensional cognitive system

=> In which I explain how documentation can replace LLMs and other data-scraping based input formats for connectivist architectures. Why should this architecture produce interresting results on the "purely cognitive" level. How should this architecture produce interesting results at on the civilizational level.

Data science is a branch of marketing, not science

## Return to (generalized) mother

Sumer -> ¬freedom (Summer -> harsh conditions ; Sumer -> legislation ; Sumer -> "education" ; Sumer -> ...)
It is a well observed fact of attachment theory: the exploration phase with "return to home base/security" (-> world, <- mother)
We should consider ourselves in this phase, in a "cosmological theory of attachment", as a new element. We must seek help from existing network, which we do through logic & math, science & engineering, art & philosophy, love & communication. The first 4 := <- generalized mother (mother nature); last 4 := -> world (unknown). <-> ⇒ freedom.
Our AGI architecture is a structure to build/implement "<-", it must have a dual (in the mathematical sense) which gives "->" (I suspect this structure is the unabridged freedom allowed by the "bridge to mother nature").



Regardless of the cultures you have access to, 


Probably not what is generally expected though, and in many ways opposite to the promised "high-tech heaven" of ultraconnected quantum AIs powered by nuclear fusion inside a blockchain economy, or something along those lines.


, which is smart enough to notice it (see Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) but dumb enough to keep going (see every United Nations Climate Change Conference) 

On the The AGI system can provide "positive" counterparts to those negatitions, and take in this kind of "cognitive energy" to produce something: 
it doesn't require to accept certain views in advance and it can define its own purpose as it evolves through its participants; 

As for the "paths to complexity" of alternative paradigms, they are once again largely ignored, as with African egalitarianism. 

    
    
    There is nothing myserious about those abstract spaces, they are used daily every time someone conceives a story, a painting, a theorem or even uters a sentence. The ones we use are nevertheless part of a large web, 
    
    
     ~~Abstract spaces, like novels or , emerged in a new abstract space, and their production didn't require any modification to the existing world.~~ What the AGI system can do is create a coherent abstract space which can serve as a very elaborate map of the existing world. As such it can help our own evolution in this world.

The research community, like kings, is afraid of "the crowd"---more than kings, this blocks the exploration of new social structures.



Bak, Hoffmayer (biosemiotics), porges, 

In if we think in terms of the theory of attachment (paragraph 1), we can ask: what is the future of a new element arriving on the network, the markets in this case? This element is a human destined to be a job seeker in a job market first, and second, conditioned by their job status, they are consummers in the goods & services market (the role of "the left" has been to mitigate and pacify this act of violence, but it has not found an efficient alternative). This is preceded by a period during which the "natural attachment mechanisms" of family ties are supposed to take care of the newly arriving human while the selection process starts at the end of infancy and ends at the end of adolecence. It has been called, and
It would take a much longer article to discuss the global economy and its possibly more efficient alternatives, but I would like nonetheless to give pointers to some conjectures I made, about "modules" and their interactions---also too intricate to be properly included here. I then leave a large part of the construction to the imagination of the reader. The current economy is based on debt, which
