## Abstract

After some reflections on "team-oriented" game theory and collective intelligence, I became convinced that the good old notion of documentation is the key to creating scalable and interconnected open source projects, together with a new form of Artificial General Intelligence (based on the biomimetic mathematical model proposed by Yuri Manin and Matilde Marcolli in "Homotopy-theoretic and categorical models of neural information networks").

Before becoming a program, every project is a concept. The proper start to collective endeavor must be the construction of a consensus around the concept and its representation by mathematics-inspired documentation.

This should include both the program and, crucially, its context. Using abstract math and elaborate notions of equivalence and composability (category theory), if enough open source projects formulate their context with modularity in mind, then we get a coherent "map of their shared world".

In a modus operandi inspired by dynamical systems theory, the output of this collective effort can be plugged back into an AGI system. This is made possible by the fact that the mathematical structures used by Manin and Marcolli for their model of "cognitive machines" are the same as the mathematical structures allowing compatibility between documentation of programs (homotopy type theory, âˆž-groupoids).

In this way, open source development can lead to open science. An autonomous, network-oriented and truly peer reviewed science, free from reductionist methodologies as well as age-old assumptions stemming from deference to hierarchies which prevent the logical invalidation of patriarchy, racism and all forms of discrimination, armed conflicts, class struggle and the need for poverty, etc. While this link between "geeky" technicalities and "radical" political views seems unnatural at first sight, again due to assumptions, it is nevertheless well-founded and necessary for understanding on either side of the issue.

The implementation of such open projects is cheap, accessible and, given the current global situation, we can expect spontaneous interest and participation from the public.
